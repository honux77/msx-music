Apple II Mockingboard music player that plays VGZ (compressed VGM) files from MSX games.

MSX-DOS PSG 포트 작업은 `/Users/honux/HobbyProjects/msx-music/msx`에서 진행 중입니다.

[Play in Browser (apple2ts.com)](https://apple2ts.com/#https://github.com/honux77/apple2-music/raw/main/realeases/music-latest.dsk)

## Features

- Plays AY-3-8910 PSG music from VGZ/VGM files
- Supports Mockingboard slots 4, 5, or 7
- Stereo output (both PSG chips)
- Loop support for continuous playback
- 3-channel volume visualizer (one bar per line)
- HGR title screen on boot (skipped on menu return)
- Auto-return to menu after song ends or ESC
- DOS zero page save/restore for clean BASIC integration

## Requirements

### Build Tools
- Python 3.x
- cc65 toolchain (ca65, ld65)
- Java 8+ (for AppleCommander)
- Pillow (Python image library)

### Hardware/Emulator
- Apple II with Mockingboard
- Or emulator with Mockingboard support (AppleWin, MAME, etc.)

## Building

```bash
# Build player binary only
make

# Convert all VGZ files to A2M format
make convert

# Convert all VGZ files to MPSG format (MSX-DOS skeleton)
make convert-msx FPS=60

# Convert title PNG to HGR image
make image

# Create disk image (requires pre-built assets)
make disk

# Full build from scratch (convert + image + disk)
make all-disk

# Convert specific VGZ file and rebuild
make play VGZ="vgz/01 Title.vgz"

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Usage

1. Boot the disk image in an Apple II emulator or real hardware
2. Title screen is displayed on first boot
3. Select Mockingboard slot (4, 5, or 7)
4. Choose a song from the menu
5. Press ESC to stop - automatically returns to menu
6. Songs without loop also return to menu when finished
7. Select 0 to quit

## A2M Format

Custom compact format for Apple II:

```
Header (16 bytes):
  0-3:  Magic "A2M\x00"
  4-5:  Data length (little-endian)
  6-7:  Loop offset (0 = no loop)
  8-15: Reserved

Data Stream:
  $00-$0D vv  : Write value vv to PSG register
  $80-$FD     : Wait 1-126 frames (60Hz)
  $FD         : Loop marker
  $FE         : End of song
  $FF nn nn   : Extended wait (16-bit frame count)
```

## Memory Map
